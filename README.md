*Sometimes, neatness counts.*

If you are trying to puzzle out a stack trace, 
pick a critical line of text out of a long stream of console output,
or compare two streams of binary data, a little bit of formatting can go a long way.

That's what _pretty_ is for.  It adds support for pretty output where it counts:

* Readable output for exceptions
* ANSI font and background color support
* Hex dump of binary data
* Hex dump of binary deltas
* Formatting data into columns
